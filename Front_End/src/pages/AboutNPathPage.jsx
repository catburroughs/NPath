    <dt>Why is it called an 'NPath' Board?</dt>
    <dd><li>On a literal level the maze has countless or 'N' numbers of paths to experience and, in using the board to focus on your physical senses, the board can help to create an 'empathic' grounding experience.</li></dd>
    <dt>Can I use it immediately?</dt>
    <dd><li>Absolutely! The NPath Board has optimal defaults set, all you need to do is go to Activate Board and choose Activate.</li></dd>
    <dt>What does 'Mode' mean?</dt>
    <dd><li>The NPath Board has two preset soundscapes with assigned touchpads - these are called 'Modes.' The user can upload their own .wav sounds and assign touchpads to each sound in 'Creator Mode.' Each mode can be chosen at the Mode Page.</li></dd>
    <dd>-NPath Mode has bespoke sounds created by Glasweigian musician Alistair Davidson to create a reflective atmosphere.</dd>
    <dd>-Nature Mode features sounds from the natural world for a calming experience.</dd>
    <dt>How can I upload sounds?</dt>
    <dd><li>Go to the Mode page and change the mode to 'Creator Mode', click the 'Uploader' button afterwards, select and upload your .wav files and then assign each sound to a touchpad. Once the touchpads are assigned, all you need to do is activate the board!</li></dd>
    <dt>How do I turn the NPath Board off?</dt>
    <dd><li>Go to the Activate Board page and click 'Deatictivate'. The Board will then show as 'Off.'</li></dd>
    <dt>How does the NPath Board work?</dt>
    <dd><li>Through Capacitve Touch - a technology most widely known in phone or tablet touchscreens 
    but can also be used on almost any surface with the electrical field established through 
    electrically conducive areas created by carbon based paint or ink.</li></dd>
